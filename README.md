# CharlesRProject
This project examines a large rodent dataset. It consists of an R script for analyzing the data, three figures that graphically depict various data correlations, and a statistical test that examines the relationships graphically shown in figure 2.
The figures shown are:
  Figure 1- a scatterplot of rodent weight vs hindfoot length;
  Figure 2- a bar graph of rodent weights by species, separated by sex;
  Figure 3- a box plot of seasonal changes in average rodent weights, separated by sex.
